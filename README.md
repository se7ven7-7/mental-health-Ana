## Executive Summary
This project analyzes global mental health trends from 2007 to 2016, focusing on anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders. Using data from the World Health Organization, World Happiness Report, and World Bank, it identifies significant disparities across regions and genders. Notably, South America and the Middle East report higher anxiety rates, while women exhibit a greater prevalence of anxiety and depression.

Surprisingly, external factors such as happiness and economic conditions show limited correlation with mental health prevalence, challenging conventional assumptions. High-income countries consistently report higher levels of mental health disorders, positioning them as strategic markets for targeted entry.

Based on these findings, the study proposes a go-to-market strategy for a mental health app startup. By forming partnerships with universities and workplaces, the app can engage younger audiences and professionals, creating a differentiated value proposition. This focused approach ensures a strong market entry and maximizes impact in addressing mental health challenges.

## Problem Definition
A mental health tech startup is looking to launch an AI-driven app designed to help users manage stress and anxiety. The company requires a comprehensive go-to-market entry strategy, focusing on demand trends, target demographics, and market gaps. This project aims to analyze global mental health data, specifically anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, to provide insights that will guide the startup in differentiating its product in a competitive landscape, with a particular focus on identifying strategic market entry points, such as workplace partnerships and university trials.

## Introduction & Motivation
Mental health disorders, particularly anxiety, depression, and substance use, have become increasingly prevalent across the globe, presenting a growing challenge for societies and healthcare systems. Loss in productivity due to depression and anxiety has been estimated to cost the global economy USD 1 trillion and is forecasted to reach USD 16 trillion by 2030 (Chodavadia et al., 2023).

As individuals and organizations seek accessible, scalable solutions, AI-driven applications have emerged as promising tools to manage these conditions effectively. This project was initiated to support the startupâ€™s market entry by providing data-driven insights that will help tailor their AI-based mental health app to the needs of diverse populations. The goal is to ensure the product aligns with market demands and stands out in the competitive digital health landscape.
