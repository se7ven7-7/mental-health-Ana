# mental-health-Ana
This project analyzes global mental health trends from 2007 to 2016, focusing on anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders. Using data from the World Health Organization, World Happiness Report, and World Bank, it identifies significant disparities across regions and genders. Notably, South America and the Middle East report higher anxiety rates, while women exhibit a greater prevalence of anxiety and depression.

Surprisingly, external factors such as happiness and economic conditions show limited correlation with mental health prevalence, challenging conventional assumptions. High-income countries consistently report higher levels of mental health disorders, positioning them as strategic markets for targeted entry.

Based on these findings, the study proposes a go-to-market strategy for a mental health app startup. By forming partnerships with universities and workplaces, the app can engage younger audiences and professionals, creating a differentiated value proposition. This focused approach ensures a strong market entry and maximizes impact in addressing mental health challenges.
